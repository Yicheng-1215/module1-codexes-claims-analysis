The step i have taken.
Loaded the healthcare data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub using the Pandas library
Defined a list of columns relevant to medical diagnoses and procedure codes
Doing the analysis such as counting Frequency of Unique Values, find the most frequent, Handling Missing or Null Values, and replace it to 'Unknown'

Key finding
I find variation across states, and that tells me that healthcare providers in different regions may face unique challenges based on prevalent diagnoses.

Challengers
GitHub CSV Upload
I tried to upload the CSV file to GitHub and load it in Python, but the process failed because the file was not in the raw format required for direct access, and I got an error message. I had to use the raw file link to load the data correctly in Python.
